# Introduction 

This is my first ever open source project using New York City's Open Data Portal. I have chosen to work with the **Art Galleries in NYC** dataset after seeing the amazing **Yayoi Kusama** exhibition at David Zwirner in Chelsea, New York (yes, I waited two hours for the Infinity Room). I was also inspired by **Art Basel Miami Beach 2019**, which I am still upset I did not attend. Maybe next year?

Besides feeling inspired by art, I will focus on guiding people through the NYC Open Data Portal and display how to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Python programming language. I will also create maps and visualizations solely with Python. 

***Why only Manhattan?*** I originally analyzed all five boroughs, but Manhattan had an overwhelming number of galleries. Thus, for simplicity, this analysis only focuses on neighborhoods in Manhattan.

I am new to the open source community, so feedback is very welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read my notebook.
